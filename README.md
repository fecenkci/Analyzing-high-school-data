## Analyzing New York City High School Data

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. **My aim in this project is to investigate the correlations between SAT scores and demographics and try to find out if SAT scores correlate with factors like race, gender, income, and more.**

New York City makes its data on high school SAT scores available online, as well as the demographics for each high school. The same website has several related data sets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the data sets I'll be using:

- [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City

- [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school
