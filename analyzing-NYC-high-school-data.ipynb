    "## Analyzing New York City High School Data (Test Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. **My aim in this project is to investigate the correlations between SAT scores and demographics and try to find out if SAT scores correlate with factors like race, gender, income, and more.**\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its data on high school SAT scores available online, as well as the demographics for each high school. The same website has several related data sets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the data sets I'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "- [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "- [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school\n",
    "- [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "- [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a) - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",

In class_size we have grade and program type columns contributing to this factor. Since I am dealing with SAT scores, I only need info from grade 9-12 and General education type. In demographics data, the factor is school year and to resolve it I will only select the most recent year. The Demographic and Cohort columns are what prevent DBN from being unique in the graduation data. A Cohort appears to refer to the year the data represents, and the Demographic appears to refer to a specific demographic group. In this case, I want to pick data from the most recent Cohort available, which is 2006. I also want data from the full cohort, so I'll only pick rows where Demographic is Total Cohort.\n",
